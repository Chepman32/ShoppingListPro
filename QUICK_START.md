### If you see cache errors:

# Clean everything
yarn cache clean
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
rm -rf ios/build

# Restart Metro with reset cache
yarn start --reset-cache
```

### If Metro port 8081 is in use:

```bash
# Kill existing process
lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill -9

# Then restart
yarn start
```

### If iOS build fails:

```bash
# Clean iOS build
cd ios
xcodebuild clean
rm -rf build
pod install
cd ..

# Run again
